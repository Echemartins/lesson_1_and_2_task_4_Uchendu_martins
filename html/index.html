            <h3 id="chr">The Charistmatic Renewal</h3>
            <p>
                Catholic Charismatic Renewal (CCR) is a spiritual movement within the Catholic 
                Church that emphasises the availability of the power and the many gifts of the 
                Holy Spirit in the life of every believer, and the need for a personal 
                relationship with God through Jesus Christ in order to live life to the fullest.
                Praising God at a prayer meeting CCR emphasises the goodness of God, and proclaims, 
                with the Church, that Godâ€™s grace is freely given to everyone. Jesus Christ fully 
                revealed God, enabling each person to know God as good, as totally giving, and as 
                one who shares fully in the human experience.
            </p>
            <h3 id="prb">The Precious Blood</h3>
            <p>
                Devotion to the Precious Blood of Jesus is one of the oldest devotions in the 
                Church. Our Blessed Mother adored the Most Precious Blood of her infant Son on 
                the day of His circumcision as the first drops of His Precious Blood were shed 
                amongst many tears for the salvation of our sinful humanity.
